# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis on Data Science Workshop Responses

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of responses collected from participants of a Data Science Workshop. Using **Python** and popular data analysis libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, the project cleans, transforms, and visualizes the dataset to derive meaningful insights.

## 🧠 Introduction

This project involves the cleaning, transformation, and visualization of participant data collected during a Data Science Workshop. It provides insight into participant demographics such as **age, weight, height,** and **travel details**, enhancing our understanding of attendees' characteristics.

---

## 🧾 Rationale Behind This Project

The goal is to gain **hands-on experience** with real-world survey data and improve practical skills in:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data transformation
- Visualization for insight generation

The project also highlights challenges like missing values and inconsistent formatting, emphasizing best practices in real-world data analytics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the workshop dataset.
2. Clean and preprocess data (renaming, handling nulls, type conversions).
3. Analyze participant characteristics (e.g., age, height, travel).
4. Visualize attributes such as age distribution.
5. Gain hands-on experience using Python data libraries.
6. Extract insights to inform future workshop strategies.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1. Data Import
- Load Excel data using `pandas.read_excel()`.

### 2. Data Inspection
- Use `df.info()`, `df.columns` to understand data structure.

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Rename columns for clarity.
- Convert data types (e.g., `Age` to numeric).
- Filter invalid values (e.g., `Age` not in range 0–100).
- Drop rows with missing (`NaN`) values.

### 4. Data Transformation
- Standardize column names.
- Ensure dataset consistency.

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze key attributes.
- Plot histograms and other visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

### 6. Interpretation & Insight
- Interpret visualizations and stats to gain understanding of the dataset.

## 📊 Results

### ✅ Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Columns renamed: `Age`, `Weight`, `Height`, etc.
- Converted `Age` to numeric and filtered invalid values.
- Dropped rows with missing values.

### 🧾 Data Overview
- Verified structure with `df.info()` and `df.columns`.

### 📈 Age Distribution Analysis
- Plotted age distribution using a histogram.

### ❌ Missing Data
- Confirmed zero missing values after cleaning using `df.isnull().sum()`.

## 🏁 Conclusions and Key Learnings

### ✅ Conclusions

The EDA workflow was successfully applied to the workshop dataset, leading to meaningful insights on participant demographics and behavior. The clean and well-structured dataset sets a foundation for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

### 📚 Key Learnings

1. **Data Cleaning is Crucial** – Ensures accurate results.
2. **Transformation Enhances Usability** – Makes analysis easier.
3. **Visualization is Powerful** – Aids in insight discovery.
4. **Libraries Mastery** – Gained real-world Python data stack skills.
5. **Insight Generation** – Identified trends useful for future decisions.
